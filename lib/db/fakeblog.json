I learned alot, but still feel I need to learn way more about git/github than what I tohught was needed to be successfull. Working with others is an entirely differnt experience than working alone. Working in a group feels like we haven't done much individually, when in reality we got so much done; it's a weird feeling, how all these small pieces that seem like nothing all come together to make something big."
