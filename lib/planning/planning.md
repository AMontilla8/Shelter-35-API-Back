## Planning

- Description of Project: The idea of our project is a basic version of reddit but for Cat Shelters. It just so happens that we are contributing to Shelter 35. The idea of the collaborative blog site is that we can collectively complain or praise the Cat Shelter, but anonymously. We can create content, read content and are determining if we want to give people the option of updating or deleting content. Our Bronze version will issue a random cat image as an avatar to each user.

- Models: See "./Models/"

- Git workflow: Centralized workflow

- See this folder

## General Scope

- A majority of our database will be user generated, so we've seeded a sample post to show that we can seed data and pull from that API.

- We are also building a few different different components so we can show a new post, historical posts, a home page, etc.

- We are assigning each post a random cat image for an Avatar, and they will have the ability to create a post that is consistent of a title, a comment, a random cat image URL and the for our bronze version, the date of the post.

- We are planning to search through our database by \_id, title, delete by \_id and update by \_id.
